# Women Who Code Front End Study Group Project

This repository is a beginner-friendly project started by [Women Who Code Front End](https://www.womenwhocode.com/frontend) to learn about front end technologies as well as how to collaborate on an open source project.

Currently it is deployed at [https://frontendstudygroup.github.io](https://frontendstudygroup.github.io) using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

We are collaborating with [Women Who Code Cloud](https://www.womenwhocode.com/cloud) to implement other deployment methods like deploying the app to Azure or AWS with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines.

## Local Setup for Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Getting Started
After you clone this repository to your local machine, execute the command `npm install` in your favorite terminal to install all the npm packages locally.

To run the application locally execute the command `npm start`. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Testing

Executing the command `npm test` launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) in the Create React App documentation for more information.

### Deployment

Executing the command `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the Create React App documentation for more information.

### Learn More
